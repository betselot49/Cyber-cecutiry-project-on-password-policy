# Password policy
Express.js backend project on password policy

* Password complexity:
Passwords will be required to include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. We will show how small password will be easy for bruteforce attack
 Pas*sword length: 
Passwords will be required to be at least 12 characters in length.
* Password expiration: 
Password expiration is an important component of a strong password policy, as it ensures that passwords are changed regularly and reduces the risk of compromised passwords being used for an extended period of time. Automated mechanisms such as password expiration policies can be implemented to ensure that users are prompted to change their password after a certain period of time, typically every 60-90 days..
* Password history: 
Password history is another important aspect of a strong password policy, as it prevents users from reusing old passwords that may have been compromised. Storing previous passwords and preventing users from reusing them can be accomplished through the use of password history policies that keep track of previous passwords and enforce rules preventing reuse.
* Account lockout: 
Account lockout is a security measure that can help prevent brute-force attacks by automatically locking user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. Accounts will be locked out after five c onsecutive failed login attempts.
* Multi-factor authentication# M
Users will be required to use multi-factor authentication, such as a one-time password or biometric authentication, to provide an additional layer of security.
